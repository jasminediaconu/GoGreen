The PostGresSQL documentation, to help me create tables with the correct constraints for a well designed database and tables.

##### What I've learned so far:
- How to make a server that handles requests.
- How to make a user safely enter sensitive data and handle these requests.
- How to encrypt data and store it safely.
- How to make well designed tables, fitted for the needs of the application in a way the client should be able to interact with it.
