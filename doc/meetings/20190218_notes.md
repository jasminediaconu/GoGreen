## `1st DEMO DEADLINE 25th February: working client and server communication`

## General Notes:
* When programming you can use the main function inside your class for testing purposes, but delete it once finished with that class

* Personal development plan has to be extended, adhere completely to the Brightspace guidelines, template also uploaded on gitlab: develop/template/personalDevelopmentTemplate.md 1-2 sentence per each point, be specific, NOT GENERAL

* Create Tags after each sprint, serves as bookmarks, possibly awards extra points, makes it easy for TA-s to trace work done during each sprint.

* Naming conventions and structure discussed, Wout will upload a document on this.

* What is continous integration, checkstyle and how to use them? Continous Integration means: After creating tests, tests are automatically run, checking if the new features break anything.

* Use JavaDOC comments as we learned during OOP

* If complicated functions, in function comments // write per line comments inside the function the explain it in depth

* Create feature branches from the develop branch to work on your tasks. Naming convention: all lowercase and - between words, e.q. feature/login-screen

* Commits are either done to your feature branch or to the develop, master is merged with develop weekly
