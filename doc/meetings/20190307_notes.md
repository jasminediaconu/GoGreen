## `2nd DEMO DEADLINE 18th of March: full workflow of "Eating a vegetarian meal"`

## General Notes:

* Agenda needs (possibly) to retrieve data from Activity class, the popup buttons for food, energy and transport needs to show up.

* Dropped the idea of the uuID

* For the Remember me check box: store username and hashed password on a file on the computer

* Profile window: should we keep the option for the solar power implementation only in the Profile page or also whenever we add a new activity? 
  Which information to add in the Profile window? Add email under username and make it editable, as well as the option to change the password, 
  toggle button to select/unselect the implementation of solar power and a button to save changes.

* Overview window: implement an algorithm to show the amount of CO2 saved (per week, month, year). In the Overview page 
  we will also implement the badges with the achievements and the streak of days the user is logging in activities. 

* Leaderboard window: add functionality to follow/unfollow friends

* For next meeting: decide the name of the app

* Create an interface for the controllers (next sprint)
