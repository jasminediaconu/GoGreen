# Lab session 6 notes

## Attendance:
* Everybody was present
* Chair: Jasmine
* Note-taker: Wout Haakman

## `Today was the second deadline demo`

## General Notes:
* The demo was successfull, we passed the test coverage and the checkstyle is at a reasonable score

* Everybody still has to add some bullet points for the past sprint reviews

* We had a discussion about how adding an Energy activity should work
    - We decided that it should be changed on the profile under a text field only accepting integers, specifying the amount of solar panels or leds.
    - This should be reflected on the database as well.
    - Also, there can only be one unique energy activity per day, where all the same energy activities should be aggregated in one activity.
    
* We might disable server tests for a faster boot

* We worked out some small features for improved user intuitivity

* We brainstormed some new Achievement ideas, and how this should be implemented
