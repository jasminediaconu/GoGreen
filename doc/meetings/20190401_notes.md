# Lab session 8 notes

## Attendance:
* Everybody was present
* Chair: Svetoslav
* Note-taker: Mandy

## `Today was the third deadline demo`

## General Notes:
* The demo went well, we have good test coverage and the checkstyle has almost no warnings

* The unit for CO2 has to be added to agenda and leaderboard

* The icon can be set in GitLab (Jim has authority to change it)

* There was a difference between badge and achievement, but we interpreted it differently
    - We believe what we have is fine

* Contribution is measured in amounts of changes, commits (tools: gitblame, gitinspector)

* The draft for the report should be in Assignments of Brightspace (Thursday)

* Greatreadme
    - Instructions on how to run the app should be more general, as not everyone has experience with Maven or IntelliJ
    - Tone down the screenshots, maybe replace them by gif

* Most of the app works, the Overview still a bit incomplete

* The e-mail service still has to be done and will hopefully give bonus points

* There were issues with sign up/login, but those were resolved

* There is no explicit guideline on the presentation

* Focus of presentation is why we people need to be more sustainable

* We brainstormed about the 'Value Sensitive Design' section
    - There should not be a 'Responsible Computer Science' section
    - What stakeholders/values we could add
