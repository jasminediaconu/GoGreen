# Sprint Review of Sprint 1 & 2

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Work distribution
During the lab, we had some difficulties to evenly and efficiently distribute the workload to each member.

In order to solve this problem, we decided to populate the scrumboard backlog with everything that needs to
 be done according the to rubric and prioritize using the MoSCoW and follow it.

## Adjustments from previous sprints
 - Organize extra meeting
 - We decided to organize an extra meeting in order to check everyone's progress and what still needs 
    to be done for the next sprint. 

## Adjustments for next sprint
 - Crete MoSCoW
 - Organize extra meeting

## Reflection on the previous sprint
 - The first sprint was a just a weekend long so did not engage with the project enough to be able to reflect.
 - During the second sprint the team researched the HTTPS protocol
 - JavaFX, JFoenix, Scenebuilder, Maven amongst other technologies
 - It was a slow start but we got up to speed
