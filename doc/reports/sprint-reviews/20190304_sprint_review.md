# Sprint Review of Sprint 3

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Errors when running the app the first time

There were a few problems with Maven when trying to run the application for the first time.

This was solved by doing 'clean' again.


## Adjustments from previous sprints
 - Extra meeting
   - Setting things up with Maven
   - Progress was checked
   - Login and main screen were linked

## Adjustments for next sprint
 - People that didn't get to code this sprint will get the chance to write more code
 - More test
   - There was not enough material to be tested this sprint

## Reflection on the previous sprint
### Mandy (mchang)
 - The extra meeting was very helpful with getting more work done (linking screens)
 - The division of tasks was hard, because everything build on top of each other

### Jasmine (jdiaconu)
 - The extra meeting helped me setting Maven correctly
 - We found out that the Login screen and the Main page didn't have a coherent design, this problem was fixed
 - Some minor bugs in the GUI have been fixed
 
 
 ### Giuliano (gforghieri)
- We were able to progress a lot during the previous sprint, thanks to the extra meeting we had.
- Using the rubric and the moscow for issue distribution made us more efficient.
- So now for the coming sprint we distributed the tasks better, to give everyone an equal amount of workload.

### Wout (whaakman)
- We got everything to work properly and everybody is finally getting set up.
- Extra meetings greatly improved our productivity and should be done more in the future.

### Gino (gtramontina)
- The extra meeting was useful as it made sure i actually had work done before the weekend.
- I didn't have my IDE set up correctly, but that issue was resolved during the monday meeting
