# Sprint Review

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Errors when running the app the first time

There were a few problems with Maven when trying to run the application for the first time.

This was solved by doing 'clean' again.


## Adjustments from previous sprints
 - Extra meeting
   - Setting things up with Maven
   - Progress was checked
   - Login and main screen were linked

## Adjustments for next sprint
 - People that didn't get to code this sprint will get the chance to write more code
 - More test
   - There was not enough material to be tested this sprint

## Reflection on the previous sprint
### Mandy (mchang)
 - The extra meeting was very helpful with getting more work done (linking screens)
 - The division of tasks was hard, because everything build on top of each other
 
 ### Wout (whaakman)
 - Since we still had to start up with the project a bit, we had a lot of stuff
  that depended on other code, which slowed the productivity down.
 - Thanks to the extra meeting, we could resolve a lot of unknown issues.
 - This current sprint will be a lot better divided, which was a problem in the last sprint.
