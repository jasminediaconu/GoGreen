# Sprint Review of Sprint 4

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Compatibility issue
It appears that the branch user-profile has some compatibility issues.

To solve this task have been divided to fix these issues. 

### Problem 2: Checkstyle
We have to many checkstyle warnings

To solve this we are going to follow and implement the checkstyle very strictly.


## Adjustments from previous sprints
 - Changing the name
    - We changed the name of the program to Greenly.

## Adjustments for next sprint
 - Increase branch coverage
 - Apply the checkstyle to every class

## Reflection on the previous sprint

### Mandy (mchang)
 - 1
 - 2

### Jasmine (jdiaconu)
- The workload was better spread as some people didn't have to many commits
- Thanks to the extra meeting we were able to link the GUI parts together (MainScreen and LoginScreen)
 
### Giuliano (gforghieri)
- The extra meeting on Thursday or Friday became a habit for the group, since we experienced that it significantly increases productivity
- We were able to finish most of the requirements for week6 demo2 during sprint 4

### Wout (whaakman)
- We got better at dividing the workload and making it fair for everybody
- Commits went better and more structured, we had a better oversight of the project progress
- A lot of progress has been made and I was happy to see that everybody was putting an increasing amount of effort into the project

### Gino (gtramontina)
- Communication was better then it was before and it seems to still be improving.
- We all got more structured in committing changes and working together.
