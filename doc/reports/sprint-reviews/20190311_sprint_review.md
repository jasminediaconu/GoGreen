# Sprint Review

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Compatibility issue
It appears that the branch user-profile has some compatibility issues.

To solve this task have been divided to fix these issues. 

###Problem 2: Checkstyle

To solve this we are going to follow and implement the checkstyle very strictly.


## Adjustments from previous sprints
 - Changing the name
    - We changed the name of the program to Greenly.

## Adjustments for next sprint
 - Increase branch coverage
 - Apply the checkstyle to every class
