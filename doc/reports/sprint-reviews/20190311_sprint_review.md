# Sprint Review of Sprint 4

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Compatibility issue
It appears that the branch user-profile has some compatibility issues.

To solve this task have been divided to fix these issues. 

### Problem 2: Checkstyle
We have to many checkstyle warnings

To solve this we are going to follow and implement the checkstyle very strictly.


## Adjustments from previous sprints
 - Changing the name
    - We changed the name of the program to Greenly.

## Adjustments for next sprint
 - Increase branch coverage
 - Apply the checkstyle to every class

### Jasmine (jdiaconu)
- The workload was better spread as some people didn't have to many commits
- Thanks to the extra meeting we were able to link the GUI parts together (MainScreen and LoginScreen)
 
 
 ### Giuliano (gforghieri)
- The extra meeting on Thursday or Friday became a habit for the group, since we experienced that it significantly increases productivity
- We were able to finish most of the requirements for week6 demo2 during sprint 4
