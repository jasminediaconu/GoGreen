# Sprint Review of Sprint 5

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Midterm test
Unfortunately the midterm test ate more of our time than originally expected.

We progressed a lot but not according to what was scheduled for this sprint.

### Problem 2: Communication
Especially the first half of the week and also the additional meeting we had, 
the main confliction point was communication.

There should have been a better understanding of others progress which could have been communicated better than we did this sprint. 
This also became apparent in the additional meeting, where it was not clear for some team members when it took place.


## Adjustments from previous sprints
 - Increase branch coverage
    - We did increase the branch coverage and are on track to receive the additional points for 95% coverage
- Apply the checkstyle to every class
    - Although it mostly happened at the beginning of the most recent meeting, we did work more to cover the checkstyle

## Adjustments for next sprint
 - Focus on making the application work consistently
 - Finish up the application

## Reflection on the previous sprint

### Wout Haakman (whaakman)
- The sprint went fine, given that the midterm took place we still got a lot done.
- I forsee the application to be finished soon, and this sprint gave us a good ground base to go from.
- Where communication was a bit poor at first, we can finally see all team members picking up to regularly update one another and ask questions.
