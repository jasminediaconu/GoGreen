# Sprint Review of Sprint 5

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Midterm test
Unfortunately the midterm test ate more of our time than originally expected.

We progressed a lot but not according to what was scheduled for this sprint.

### Problem 2: Communication
Especially the first half of the week and also the additional meeting we had, 
the main conflict point was communication.

There should have been a better understanding of others progress which could have been communicated better than we did this sprint. 
This also became apparent in the additional meeting, where it was not clear for some team members when it took place.


## Adjustments from previous sprints
 - Increase branch coverage
    - We did increase the branch coverage and are on track to receive the additional points for 95% coverage
- Apply the checkstyle to every class
    - Although it mostly happened at the beginning of the most recent meeting, we did work more to cover the checkstyle

## Adjustments for next sprint
 - Focus on making the application work consistently
 - Finish up the application

## Reflection on the previous sprint

### Wout Haakman (whaakman)
- The sprint went fine, given that the midterm took place we still got a lot done.
- I forsee the application to be finished soon, and this sprint gave us a good ground base to go from.
- Where communication was a bit poor at first, we can finally see all team members picking up to regularly update one another and ask questions.

### Jasmine (jdiaconu)
- Despite of the midterm, we still managed to complete the Demo and fulfill all its requirements
- The test coverage got really high and we were able to implement Mockito
- The extra meeting was definitely needed to take stock of the situation as the first part of the week we weren't able to make much progress due to the midterm

### Giuliano (gforghieri)
- We completed everything for the demo's requirement.
- The extra meeting on Friday made sure that we also got the test coverage up.
- This sprint we will hopefully get close to or actually finishing the coding part of the project.

### Mandy (mchang)
- The demo went well
- We seem to be very up-to-date with demo's
- I had a few problems with contents in the table of the leaderboard, it was fixed
