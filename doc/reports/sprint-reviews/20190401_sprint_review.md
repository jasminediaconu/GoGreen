# Sprint Review of Sprint 7

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1:
Overview.fxml did not load since server requests were changed.
             
### Problem 2:
While working on the Checkstyle fixing cyclomatic complexity took restructuring of some code.
 
## Adjustments from previous sprints
Focused on improving metrics, started working on report and presentation.
             
## Adjustments for next sprint
No extra meeting, so better communication via GitLab and Discord needed.

## Reflection on the previous sprint

### Wout Haakman (whaakman)

### Jasmine (jdiaconu)
- We completed most of the main tasks so we had more time to focus on small fixes, bonus features, the presentation and report
- We didn't encounter many problems during this sprint and the ones we had are fixed

### Giuliano (gforghieri)

### Mandy (mchang)
- Not many changes were made.
- Overall the sprint went fine.

### Gino (gtramontina)
- There was less pressure on everyone since most tasks were done.
- Communication was not as good as always, since there was less pressure on the group.

### Svetoslav (sstanoev)
