# Sprint Review of Sprint 8

## Main problems Encountered

### Problem 1:
Badges popup progress: the data was retrieved from the database whenever the badge was hovered causing to many requests to the server.

### Problem 2:
Some checkstyle warnings had to be still fixed and the test coverage needed to be increased again to 95% due to some changes in a few classes.

### Problem 3:
Grammar/styling improvements had to be made to the final report.

## Adjustments from previous sprints
Focused on improving metrics, worked on the report and fixed the bugs in the application.
             
## Adjustments for next sprint
- The report still needs to be improved and there is no extra meeting scheduled as the work is almost completed. 
- We scheduled a personal deadline for the report in order to make everything go smoothly.

## Reflection on the previous sprint

### Jasmine (jdiaconu)
- Everyone contributed to the report in order to receive feedback from the TA and seek for improvements.
- Most of the application bugs were fixed, higher importance was given to the Checkstyle warnings and to the Tests.

### Wout (whaakman)
- The report final draft went well, except for some small spelling errors.
- There are still some small bugs left, but those will be fixed before the next presentation.
