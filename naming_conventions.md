#Naming conventions

##Classes:
All capitals for each word e.q.  TestingClass
No underscores
Be very exact about the naming of the class, make it understandable what the class is for

##Variables:
Camelcase starting with lowercase numPerRow
Same as classes. Don't use underscores and be exact about the naming

##Functions:
Same as variables. Camelcase except for first letter, don't use underscores and be exact about the naming

## Packages:
Packages should always be lowercase
Divide into multiple folders if needed with a '.' (dot)
Naming should be exact and explain what classes can be found in that package

## Folder Structure:
E.g.:
src/main.java.client.Main.java
src/main.java.client.login.LogInScreen.java
src/main.java.server.Main.java
etc.

##Branches:
Keep it short
Don't use spaces
Copy name from Issue page, from GitLab when possible
Should look like: features/X (where X is the issue name or an exact name for the feature)
